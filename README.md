## I am currently a student of Computer Technology Engineering at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education.

ðŸ’¬ I consider myself a somewhat lazy person, but when something catches my attention I focus too much on it and thanks to that I have achieved great things. I like to solve problems with a technological approach.

ðŸŒ± Some of my passions are: Animation, music production, and of course, programming. I have a lot of fun solving problems, it's like putting together a puzzle in which each piece leads you to the next piece.

âš¡ I really enjoy learning as I go along, I know that sometimes it can be tiring, but I consider that learning by doing is the best way to do it.
